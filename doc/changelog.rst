Changelog
=========

2.0.0a3
-------

Fixes:

* Jinja templates can now be loaded in StrictUndefined mode.
* Remove an implicit dependency on `packaging`
* Fixed an error caused by the fallback implementation of `gettext()` (when used in templates)

2.0.0a2
-------

Breaking changes:

* Removed support for Python 3.8.
* Use of the `boto` library has been replaced by `boto3`. S3FileAdmin and S3Storage now accept an `s3_client` parameter taking a `boto3.client('s3')` instance rather than `aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, and `region` parameters.

2.0.0a1
-------

Fixes:

* Fixes compatibility with WTForms 3.2+.
* The `Apply` button for filters will show/hide correctly again
* Fix `translations_path` attribute when Flask-Admin is used with Flask-Babel
* Some translation updates.
* Date fields no longer override `widget` if set in `form_args`
* “Save and Continue Editing” button no longer discards the “return URL” (allowing to retain filters when switching back to the list)

2.0.0a0
-------

Breaking changes:

* Added support for Python 3.12
* Dropped support for Python 3.7
* Flask-BabelEx is no longer supported; the package is no longer maintained and Flask-Babel is recommended/active instead.
* Flask-Mongoengine is no longer supported due to that package being unmaintained.
* Bootstrap2 and Bootstrap3 themes are no longer available.
* `Admin()` now takes a `theme` parameter that encapsulates all of the configuration options for theming the admin instance. This replaces the `template_mode` parameter.
* All remaining Flask-Admin config has been namespaced under `FLASK_ADMIN_`.

New features:

* Flask-Admin now supports the `host_matching` mode of Flask apps. See documentation for how to configure this where needed.
* Flask-Admin is now compatible with SQLAlchemy v2+, Flask v3+, WTForms v3+, and Pillow v10+.
* Flask-Admin now declares its dependencies and supported dependency versions more cleanly, including using pip extras. If you use Flask-Admin with SQLAlchemy, for example, you should use `pip install flask-admin[sqlalchemy]` or list `flask-admin[sqlalchemy]` in your requirements.txt or pyproject.toml files.
* Apps using content security policies to restrict the assets that can be loaded can now whitelist Flask-Admin's assets by passing a `csp_nonce_generator` function to the Admin instance. See examples or documentation for how to configure this where needed.
* `page_size_options` can now be configured on Admin models, to restrict the page sizes that users can select. These are now enforced properly and cannot be bypassed by URL hacking.

And various smaller bug fixes and documentation updates.

Advanced Functionality
======================

Enabling CSRF Protection
------------------------

To add CSRF protection to the forms that are generated by *ModelView* instances, use the
SecureForm class in your *ModelView* subclass by specifying the *form_base_class* parameter::

    from flask_admin.form import SecureForm
    from flask_admin.contrib.sqla import ModelView

    class CarAdmin(ModelView):
        form_base_class = SecureForm

SecureForm requires WTForms 2 or greater. It uses the WTForms SessionCSRF class
to generate and validate the tokens for you when the forms are submitted.

CSP support
-----------

To support `CSP <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html>`_
in Flask-Admin, you can pass a `csp_nonce_generator` function through to Flask-Admin on
initialisation. This function should return a CSP nonce that will be attached to all
`<script>` and `<style>` resources. You are responsible for making sure that your Flask
responses include an appropriate 'Content-Security-Policy` header that also includes the
same nonce value.

We recommend using `Flask-Talisman <https://pypi.org/project/flask-talisman/>`_. Here's an example
of how to configure Flask-Admin to inject CSP nonce values::

    app = Flask(__name__)

    talisman = Talisman(
        app,
        content_security_policy={
            "default-src": "'self'",
        },
        content_security_policy_nonce_in=["script-src", "style-src"]
    )
    csp_nonce_generator = app.jinja_env.globals["csp_nonce"]  # this is talisman's generator function

    admin = admin.Admin(app, name="Example", theme=Bootstrap4Theme(), csp_nonce_generator=csp_nonce_generator)

If you decide to use a content security policy, you should pay close attention to the policy you set to
make sure it is appropriate for your project's security needs.

If you create any of your own templates for Flask-Admin pages, you will need to inject the CSP nonces yourself as appropriate.

Adding Custom Javascript and CSS
--------------------------------

To add custom JavaScript or CSS in your *ModelView* use *extra_js* or *extra_css* parameters::

    class MyModelView(ModelView):
        extra_js = ['https://example.com/custom.js']
        extra_css = ['https://example.com/custom.css']

Localization With Flask-Babel
-----------------------------

Flask-Admin comes with translations for several languages.
Enabling localization is simple:

#. Install `Flask-Babel <https://github.com/python-babel/flask-babel/>`_ to do the heavy
   lifting.

        pip install flask-babel

#. Create a locale selector function::

        def get_locale():
            if request.args.get('lang'):
                session['lang'] = request.args.get('lang')
            return session.get('lang', 'en')

#. Initialize Flask-Babel by creating instance of `Babel` class::

        from flask import Flask
        from flask_babel import Babel

        app = Flask(__name__)
        babel = Babel(app, locale_selector=get_locale)

Now, you could try a French version of the application at: `http://localhost:5000/admin/?lang=fr <http://localhost:5000/admin/?lang=fr>`_.

Go ahead and add your own logic to the locale selector function. The application can store locale in
a user profile, cookie, session, etc. It can also use the `Accept-Language`
header to make the selection automatically.

If the built-in translations are not enough, look at the `Flask-Babel documentation <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Babel/>`_
to see how you can add your own.

Using with Flask in `host_matching` mode
----------------------------------------

If Flask is configured with `host_matching` enabled, then all routes registered on the app need to know which host(s) they should be served for.

This requires some additional explicit configuration for Flask-Admin by passing the `host` argument to `Admin()` calls.

#. With your Flask app initialised::

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__, host='my.domain.com', static_host='static.domain.com')


Serving Flask-Admin on a single, explicit host
**********************************************
Construct your Admin instance(s) and pass the desired `host` for the admin instance::

        class AdminView(admin.BaseView):
            @admin.expose('/')
            def index(self):
                return self.render('template.html')

        admin1 = admin.Admin(app, url='/admin', host='admin.domain.com')
        admin1.add_view(AdminView())

Flask's `url_for` calls will work without any additional configuration/information::

        url_for('admin.index', _external=True) == 'http://admin.domain.com/admin')


Serving Flask-Admin on all hosts
********************************
Pass a wildcard to the `host` parameter to serve the admin instance on all hosts::

        class AdminView(admin.BaseView):
            @admin.expose('/')
            def index(self):
                return self.render('template.html')

        admin1 = admin.Admin(app, url='/admin', host='*')
        admin1.add_view(AdminView())

If you need to generate URLs for a wildcard admin instance, you will need to pass `admin_routes_host` to the `url_for` call::

        url_for('admin.index', admin_routes_host='admin.domain.com', _external=True) == 'http://admin.domain.com/admin')
        url_for('admin.index', admin_routes_host='admin2.domain.com', _external=True) == 'http://admin2.domain.com/admin')

.. _file-admin:

Managing Files & Folders
------------------------

To manage static files instead of database records, Flask-Admin comes with
the FileAdmin plug-in. It gives you the ability to upload, delete, rename, etc. You
can use it by adding a FileAdmin view to your app::

    from flask_admin.contrib.fileadmin import FileAdmin

    import os.path as op

    # Flask setup here

    admin = Admin(app, name='microblog', theme=Bootstrap4Theme())

    path = op.join(op.dirname(__file__), 'static')
    admin.add_view(FileAdmin(path, '/static/', name='Static Files'))


FileAdmin also has out-of-the-box support for managing files located on a Amazon Simple Storage Service
bucket. To add it to your app::

    from flask_admin import Admin
    from flask_admin.contrib.fileadmin.s3 import S3FileAdmin

    admin = Admin()

    admin.add_view(S3FileAdmin('files_bucket', 'us-east-1', 'key_id', 'secret_key')

You can disable uploads, disable file deletion, restrict file uploads to certain types, etc.
Check :mod:`flask_admin.contrib.fileadmin` in the API documentation for more details.

Adding new file backends
************************

You can also implement your own storage backend by creating a class that implements the same
methods defined in the `LocalFileStorage` class. Check :mod:`flask_admin.contrib.fileadmin` in the
API documentation for details on the methods.

Adding A Redis Console
----------------------

Another plug-in that's available is the Redis Console. If you have a Redis
instance running on the same machine as your app, you can::

    from redis import Redis
    from flask_admin.contrib import rediscli

    # Flask setup here

    admin = Admin(app, name='microblog', theme=Bootstrap4Theme())

    admin.add_view(rediscli.RedisCli(Redis()))


Replacing Individual Form Fields
--------------------------------

The `form_overrides` attribute allows you to replace individual fields within a form.
A common use-case for this would be to add a *What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get* (WYSIWIG) editor, or to handle
file / image uploads that need to be tied to a field in your model.

WYSIWIG Text Fields
*******************
To handle complicated text content, you can use
`CKEditor <https://ckeditor.com/>`_ by subclassing some of the built-in WTForms
classes as follows::

    from wtforms import TextAreaField
    from wtforms.widgets import TextArea

    class CKTextAreaWidget(TextArea):
        def __call__(self, field, **kwargs):
            if kwargs.get('class'):
                kwargs['class'] += ' ckeditor'
            else:
                kwargs.setdefault('class', 'ckeditor')
            return super(CKTextAreaWidget, self).__call__(field, **kwargs)

    class CKTextAreaField(TextAreaField):
        widget = CKTextAreaWidget()

    class MessageAdmin(ModelView):
        extra_js = ['//cdn.ckeditor.com/4.6.0/standard/ckeditor.js']

        form_overrides = {
            'body': CKTextAreaField
        }

File & Image Fields
*******************

Flask-Admin comes with a built-in :meth:`~flask_admin.form.upload.FileUploadField`
and :meth:`~flask_admin.form.upload.ImageUploadField`. To make use
of them, you'll need to specify an upload directory and add them to the forms in question.
Image handling also requires you to have `Pillow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.8.2>`_
installed if you need to do any processing on the image files.

Have a look at the example at
https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/tree/master/examples/forms-files-images.

If you just want to manage static files in a directory, without tying them to a database model, then
use the :ref:`File-Admin<file-admin>` plug-in.

Managing Geographical Models
----------------------------

If you want to store spatial information in a GIS database, Flask-Admin has
you covered. The GeoAlchemy backend extends the SQLAlchemy backend (just as
`GeoAlchemy <https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/>`_  extends SQLAlchemy) to give you a pretty and functional map-based
editor for your admin pages.

Some notable features include:

 - Maps are displayed using the amazing `Leaflet <https://leafletjs.com/>`_ Javascript library,
   with map data from `Mapbox <https://www.mapbox.com>`_.
 - Geographic information, including points, lines and polygons, can be edited
   interactively using `Leaflet.Draw <https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw>`_.
 - Graceful fallback: `GeoJSON <https://geojson.org/>`_ data can be edited in a ``<textarea>``, if the
   user has turned off Javascript.
 - Works with a `Geometry <https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#geoalchemy2.types.Geometry>`_ SQL field that is integrated with `Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/>`_ objects.

To get started, define some fields on your model using GeoAlchemy's *Geometry*
field. Next, add model views to your interface using the ModelView class
from the GeoAlchemy backend, rather than the usual SQLAlchemy backend::

    from geoalchemy2 import Geometry
    from flask_admin.contrib.geoa import ModelView

    # .. flask initialization
    db = SQLAlchemy()
    db.init_app(app)

    class Location(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True)
        point = db.Column(Geometry("POINT"))

Some of the Geometry field types that are available include:
"POINT", "MULTIPOINT", "POLYGON", "MULTIPOLYGON", "LINESTRING" and "MULTILINESTRING".

Have a look at https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/tree/master/examples/geo_alchemy
to get started.

Display map widgets
*******************

Flask-Admin uses `Leaflet <https://leafletjs.com/>`_ to display map widgets for
geographical data. By default, this uses `MapBox <https://www.mapbox.com>`_.

To have MapBox data display correctly, you'll have to sign up for an account and include
some credentials in your application's config::

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['FLASK_ADMIN_MAPS'] = True

    # Required: configure the default centre position for blank maps
    app.config['FLASK_ADMIN_DEFAULT_CENTER_LAT'] = -33.918861
    app.config['FLASK_ADMIN_DEFAULT_CENTER_LONG'] = 18.423300

    # Required if using the default Mapbox integration
    app.config['FLASK_ADMIN_MAPBOX_MAP_ID'] = "example.abc123"
    app.config['FLASK_ADMIN_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN'] = "pk.def456"

If you want to use a map provider other than MapBox (eg OpenStreetMaps), you can override
the tile layer URLs and tile attribution attributes::

    class CityView(ModelView):
        tile_layer_url = '{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
        tile_layer_attribution = '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'

If you want to include a search box on map widgets for looking up locations, you need the following additional configuration::

    app.config['FLASK_ADMIN_MAPS_SEARCH'] = True
    app.config['FLASK_ADMIN_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY'] = 'secret'

Flask-Admin currently only supports Google Maps for map search.

Limitations
***********

There's currently no way to sort, filter, or search on geometric fields
in the admin. It's not clear that there's a good way to do so.

Customising Builtin Forms Via Rendering Rules
---------------------------------------------

Before version 1.0.7, all model backends were rendering the *create* and *edit* forms
using a special Jinja2 macro, which was looping over the fields of a WTForms form object and displaying
them one by one. This works well, but it is difficult to customize.

Starting from version 1.0.7, Flask-Admin supports form rendering rules, to give you fine grained control of how
the forms for your modules should be displayed.

The basic idea is pretty simple: the customizable rendering rules replace a static macro, so you can tell
Flask-Admin how each form should be rendered. As an extension, however, the rendering rules also let you do a
bit more: You can use them to output HTML, call Jinja2 macros, render fields, and so on.

Essentially, form rendering rules separate the form rendering from the form definition.
For example, it no longer matters in which sequence your form fields are defined.

To start using the form rendering rules, put a list of form field names into the `form_create_rules`
property one of your admin views::

    class RuleView(sqla.ModelView):
        form_create_rules = ('email', 'first_name', 'last_name')

In this example, only three fields will be rendered and `email` field will be above other two fields.

Whenever Flask-Admin sees a string value in `form_create_rules`, it automatically assumes that it is a
form field reference and creates a :class:`flask_admin.form.rules.Field` class instance for that field.

Let's say we want to display some text between the `email` and `first_name` fields. This can be accomplished by
using the :class:`flask_admin.form.rules.Text` class::

    from flask_admin.form import rules

    class RuleView(sqla.ModelView):
        form_create_rules = ('email', rules.Text('Foobar'), 'first_name', 'last_name')

Built-in Rules
**************

Flask-Admin comes with few built-in rules that can be found in the :mod:`flask_admin.form.rules` module:

======================================================= ========================================================
Form Rendering Rule                                     Description
======================================================= ========================================================
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.BaseRule`                All rules derive from this class
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.NestedRule`              Allows rule nesting, useful for HTML containers
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.Text`                    Simple text rendering rule
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.HTML`                    Same as `Text` rule, but does not escape the text
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.Macro`                   Calls macro from current Jinja2 context
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.Container`               Wraps child rules into container rendered by macro
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.Field`                   Renders single form field
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.Header`                  Renders form header
:class:`flask_admin.form.rules.FieldSet`                Renders form header and child rules
======================================================= ========================================================

.. _database-backends:

Using Different Database Backends
---------------------------------

Other than SQLAlchemy... There are five different backends for you to choose
from, depending on which database you would like to use for your application. If, however, you need
to implement your own database backend, have a look at :ref:`adding-model-backend`.

If you don't know where to start, but you're familiar with relational databases, then you should probably look at using
`SQLAlchemy`_. It is a full-featured toolkit, with support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
Oracle and MS-SQL amongst others. It really comes into its own once you have lots of data, and a fair amount of
relations between your data models. If you want to track spatial data like latitude/longitude
points, you should look into `GeoAlchemy`_, as well.

SQLAlchemy
**********

Notable features:

 - SQLAlchemy 0.6+ support
 - Paging, sorting, filters
 - Proper model relationship handling
 - Inline editing of related models

**Multiple Primary Keys**

Flask-Admin has limited support for models with multiple primary keys. It only covers specific case when
all but one primary keys are foreign keys to another model. For example, model inheritance following
this convention.

Let's Model a car with its tyres::

    class Car(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'cars'
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
        desc = db.Column(db.String(50))

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.desc

    class Tyre(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'tyres'
        car_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('cars.id'), primary_key=True)
        tyre_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        car = db.relationship('Car', backref='tyres')
        desc = db.Column(db.String(50))

A specific tyre is identified by using the two primary key columns of the ``Tyre`` class, of which the ``car_id`` key
is itself a foreign key to the class ``Car``.

To be able to CRUD the ``Tyre`` class, you need to enumerate columns when defining the AdminView::

    class TyreAdmin(sqla.ModelView):
        form_columns = ['car', 'tyre_id', 'desc']

The ``form_columns`` needs to be explicit, as per default only one primary key is displayed.

When having multiple primary keys, **no** validation for uniqueness *prior* to saving of the object will be done. Saving
a model that violates a unique-constraint leads to an Sqlalchemy-Integrity-Error. In this case, ``Flask-Admin`` displays
a proper error message and you can change the data in the form. When the application has been started with ``debug=True``
the ``werkzeug`` debugger will catch the exception and will display the stacktrace.

Peewee
******

Features:

 - Peewee 2.x+ support;
 - Paging, sorting, filters, etc;
 - Inline editing of related models;

In order to use peewee integration, you need to install two additional Python
packages: `peewee <https://docs.peewee-orm.com/>`_ and `wtf-peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/wtf-peewee/>`_.

Known issues:

 - Many-to-Many model relations are not supported: there's no built-in way to express M2M relation in Peewee

For more, check the :class:`~flask_admin.contrib.peewee` API documentation. Or look at
the Peewee example at https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/tree/master/examples/peewee.

PyMongo
*******

The bare minimum you have to provide for Flask-Admin to work with PyMongo:

 1. A list of columns by setting `column_list` property
 2. Provide form to use by setting `form` property
 3. When instantiating :class:`flask_admin.contrib.pymongo.ModelView` class, you have to provide PyMongo collection object

This is minimal PyMongo view::

  class UserForm(Form):
      name = StringField('Name')
      email = StringField('Email')

  class UserView(ModelView):
      column_list = ('name', 'email')
      form = UserForm

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      admin = Admin(app)

      # 'db' is PyMongo database object
      admin.add_view(UserView(db['users']))

On top of that you can add sortable columns, filters, text search, etc.

For more, check the :class:`~flask_admin.contrib.pymongo` API documentation. Or look at
the pymongo example at https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/tree/master/examples/pymongo.

Migrating From Django
---------------------

If you are used to `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and the *django-admin* package, you will find
Flask-Admin to work slightly different from what you would expect.

Design Philosophy
*****************

In general, Django and *django-admin* strives to make life easier by implementing sensible defaults. So a developer
will be able to get an application up in no time, but it will have to conform to most of the defaults. Of course it
is possible to customize things, but this often requires a good understanding of what's going on behind the scenes,
and it can be rather tricky and time-consuming.

The design philosophy behind Flask is slightly different. It embraces the diversity that one tends to find in web
applications by not forcing design decisions onto the developer. Rather than making it very easy to build an
application that *almost* solves your whole problem, and then letting you figure out the last bit, Flask aims to make it
possible for you to build the *whole* application. It might take a little more effort to get started, but once you've
got the hang of it, the sky is the limit... Even when your application is a little different from most other
applications out there on the web.

Flask-Admin follows this same design philosophy. So even though it provides you with several tools for getting up &
running quickly, it will be up to you, as a developer, to tell Flask-Admin what should be displayed and how. Even
though it is easy to get started with a simple `CRUD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>`_
interface for each model in your application, Flask-Admin doesn't fix you to this approach, and you are free to
define other ways of interacting with some, or all, of your models.

Due to Flask-Admin supporting more than one ORM (SQLAlchemy, Peewee, raw pymongo), the developer is even
free to mix different model types into one application by instantiating appropriate CRUD classes.

Here is a list of some of the configuration properties that are made available by Flask-Admin and the
SQLAlchemy backend. You can also see which *django-admin* properties they correspond to:

=========================================== ==============================================
Django                                      Flask-Admin
=========================================== ==============================================
actions										:attr:`~flask_admin.actions`
exclude										:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.form_excluded_columns`
fields										:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.form_columns`
form 										:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.form`
formfield_overrides 						:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.form_args`
inlines										:attr:`~flask_admin.contrib.sqla.ModelView.inline_models`
list_display 								:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.column_list`
list_filter									:attr:`~flask_admin.contrib.sqla.ModelView.column_filters`
list_per_page 								:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.page_size`
search_fields								:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.column_searchable_list`
add_form_template							:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.create_template`
change_form_template						:attr:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView.change_form_template`
=========================================== ==============================================

You might want to check :class:`~flask_admin.model.BaseModelView` for basic model configuration options (reused by all model
backends) and specific backend documentation, for example
:class:`~flask_admin.contrib.sqla.ModelView`. There's much more
than what is displayed in this table.

Overriding the Form Scaffolding
-------------------------------

If you don't want to the use the built-in Flask-Admin form scaffolding logic, you are free to roll your own
by simply overriding :meth:`~flask_admin.model.base.scaffold_form`. For example, if you use
`WTForms-Alchemy <https://github.com/kvesteri/wtforms-alchemy>`_, you could put your form generation code
into a `scaffold_form` method in your `ModelView` class.

For SQLAlchemy, if the `synonym_property` does not return a SQLAlchemy field, then Flask-Admin won't be able to figure out what to
do with it, so it won't generate a form field. In this case, you would need to manually contribute your own field::

    class MyView(ModelView):
        def scaffold_form(self):
            form_class = super(UserView, self).scaffold_form()
            form_class.extra = StringField('Extra')
            return form_class

Customizing Batch Actions
-------------------------

If you want to add other batch actions to the list view, besides the default delete action,
then you can define a function that implements the desired logic and wrap it with the `@action` decorator.

The `action` decorator takes three parameters: `name`, `text` and `confirmation`.
While the wrapped function should accept only one parameter - `ids`::

    from flask_admin.actions import action

    class UserView(ModelView):
        @action('approve', 'Approve', 'Are you sure you want to approve selected users?')
        def action_approve(self, ids):
            try:
                query = User.query.filter(User.id.in_(ids))

                count = 0
                for user in query.all():
                    if user.approve():
                        count += 1

                flash(ngettext('User was successfully approved.',
                               '%(count)s users were successfully approved.',
                               count,
                               count=count))
            except Exception as ex:
                if not self.handle_view_exception(ex):
                    raise

                flash(gettext('Failed to approve users. %(error)s', error=str(ex)), 'error')


Raise exceptions instead of flash error messages
------------------------------------------------

By default, Flask-Admin will capture most exceptions related to reading/writing models
and display a flash message instead of raising an exception. If your Flask app is running
in debug mode (ie under local development), exceptions will not be suppressed.

The flash message behaviour can be overridden with some Flask configuration.::

FLASK_ADMIN_RAISE_ON_VIEW_EXCEPTION
***********************************
Instead of turning exceptions on model create/update/delete actions into flash messages,
raise the exception as normal. You should expect the view to return a 500 to the user,
unless you add specific handling to prevent this.

FLASK_ADMIN_RAISE_ON_INTEGRITY_ERROR
************************************
This targets SQLAlchemy specifically.

Unlike the previous setting, this will specifically only affect the behaviour of
IntegrityErrors. These usually come from violations on constraints in the database,
for example trying to insert a row with a primary key that already exists.

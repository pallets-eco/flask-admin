"**Why Flask?** As a micro-framework, `Flask "
"<https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`_ lets you build web services with "
"very little overhead. It offers freedom for you, the designer, to "
"implement your project in a way that suits your particular application."

"**Why Flask-Admin?** In a world of micro-services and APIs, Flask-Admin "
"solves the boring problem of building an admin interface on top of an "
"existing data model. With little effort, it lets you manage your web "
"service's data through a user-friendly interface."

"**How does it work?** The basic concept behind Flask-Admin, is that it "
"lets you build complicated interfaces by grouping individual views "
"together in classes: Each web page you see on the frontend, represents a "
"method on a class that has explicitly been added to the interface."

msgid ""
"These view classes are especially helpful when they are tied to "
"particular database models, because they let you group together all of "
"the usual *Create, Read, Update, Delete* (CRUD) view logic into a single,"
" self-contained class for each of your models."

"**What does it look like?** Clone the `GitHub repository "
"<https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin>`_ and run the provided "
"examples locally to get a feel for Flask-Admin. There are several to "
"choose from in the `examples` directory."
